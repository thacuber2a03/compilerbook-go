# compilerbook in Go
###### more formally, "低レイヤを知りたい人のためのCコンパイラ作成入門", written in Go

A translation of Rui Ueyama's [C compiler book](https://sigbus.info/compilerbook) into Go.

### Disclaimer

The original book is in Japanese. I haven't been able to find an English version of the book so far and I
only understand Spanish and English, so I read the book using Google Translate and attempted my best
to translate the concepts and the C code. Even though the tests pass, take the code with a grain of salt.
